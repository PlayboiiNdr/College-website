            The first year of the Program’s intensive four-year curriculum is devoted to courses in life drawing, color and design, storytelling and character animation—both traditional and CG. The second year students incorporate elements such as dialogue, sound effects and music. In the third year, students include story classes geared toward short-form traditional animation, and CG computer animation.
